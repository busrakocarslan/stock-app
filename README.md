 ## I used Redux in my project to centralize application state, track state changes, and facilitate state sharing between components. Redux Toolkit also allowed me to write less code. By creating an Axios instance, I centralized my general Axios code, making it easier to manage. Formik and Yup, which I used for the first time in this project, simplified form operations and made validation easier. My code became more compliant with the DRY principle. With the nested route structure, I managed to establish a hierarchical structure between pages. Thanks to PrivateRouter, I ensured that only logged-in users could access certain pages. I also used Promise.all to increase efficiency by initiating multiple asynchronous tasks simultaneously.
